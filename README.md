MS2 - Film Anseo

This is my MS2 project - a responsive web app for movie lovers visiting or living in Ireland who may like to visit locations where famous movies have had scenes shot.
The list of movies included is not exhaustive and is, for the moment at least, built to serve the purpose of demonstrating the site only.

The list is based on my own research and preferences and ranges in time from Man of Aran (1934) to the current day.
